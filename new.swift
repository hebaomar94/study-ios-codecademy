If you only want multi-line strings to format your code neatly, and you don‚Äôt want those line breaks to actually be in your string, end each line with a \, like this:

var str2 = """
This goes \
over multiple \
lines
"""
//course hackingswift
var greeting = "Hello, playground"
print(greeting)
var name = "heba"
print(name)
let quote = "then he tapped a sign saying \"believe\" and walked away"
print(quote)

let movie = """
A day in
the life of an
Apple engineer
"""
//print(movie.uppercased())
print(movie.hasPrefix("A day"))

/*
The last piece of helpful string functionality is called hasPrefix(), and lets us know whether a string starts with some letters of our choosing:

print(movie.hasPrefix("A day"))
There‚Äôs also a hasSuffix() counterpart, which checks whether a string ends with some text:

print(filename.hasSuffix(".jpg"))
Important: Strings are case-sensitive in Swift, which means using filename.hasSuffix(".JPG") will return false because the letters in the string are lowercase.

Strings are really powerful in Swift, and we‚Äôve only really scratched the surface of what they can do!
*/
Before we‚Äôre done with integers, I want to mention one last thing: like strings, integers have some useful functionality attached. For example, you can call isMultiple(of:) on an integer to find out whether it‚Äôs a multiple of another integer.

So, we could ask whether 120 is a multiple of three like this:

let number = 120
print(number.isMultiple(of: 3))
I‚Äôm calling isMultiple(of:) on a constant there, but you can just use the number directly if you want:

print(120.isMultiple(of: 3))

//intersection method - to find matching values in two different sets:
var newSet = SetA.intersection(SetB)

//can use is .union(). This operation creates a set by combining the values of two sets together.
var NewSet = SetA.union(SetB)

//The .symmetricDifference() operation can be used to find elements that exist in one of the given sets, but not both.
//.subtracting(). This method creates a new set of elements by removing the overlapping data of one set from another set.
//Booleans do have a little extra functionality that can be useful. In particular, if you call toggle() on a Boolean it will flip a true value to false, and a false value to true. To try this out, try making gameOver a variable and modifying it like this:

var gameOver = false
print(gameOver) //false

gameOver.toggle()
print(gameOver) //true
//string together
//+
//string interoprotion
let nameb = "heba"
let quoteb = "hi my name \(nameb) go to school"
print(quoteb)
/*
Swift lets us create constants using let, and variables using var.
If you don‚Äôt intend to change a value, make sure you use let so that Swift can help you avoid mistakes.
Swift‚Äôs strings contain text, from short strings up to whole novels. They work great with emoji and any world language, and have helpful functionality such as count and uppercased().
You create strings by using double quotes at the start and end, but if you want your string to go over several lines you need to use three double quotes at the start and end.
Swift calls its whole numbers integers, and they can be positive or negative. They also have helpful functionality, such as isMultiple(of:).
In Swift decimal numbers are called Double, short for double-length floating-point number. That means they can hold very large numbers if needed, but they also aren‚Äôt 100% accurate ‚Äì you shouldn‚Äôt use them when 100% precision is required, such as when dealing with money.
There are lots of built-in arithmetic operators, such as +, -, *, and /, along with the special compound assignment operators such as += that modify variables directly.
You can represent a simple true or false state using a Boolean, which can be flipped using the ! operator or by calling toggle().
String interpolation lets us place constants and variables into our strings in a streamlined, efficient way.

An enum ‚Äì short for enumeration ‚Äì is a set of named values we can create and use in our code. They don‚Äôt have any special meaning to Swift, but they are more efficient and safer, so you‚Äôll use them a lot in your code.

To demonstrate the problem, let‚Äôs say you wanted to write some code to let the user select a day of the week. You might start out like this:

var selected = "Monday"
Later on in your code you change it, like so:

selected = "Tuesday"
That might work well in very simple programs, but take a look at this code:

selected = "January"
Oops! You accidentally typed in a month rather than a day ‚Äì what will your code do? Well, you might be lucky enough to have a colleague spot the error as they review your code, but how about this:

selected = "Friday "
That has a space at the end of Friday, and ‚ÄúFriday ‚Äù with a space is different from ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù without a space in Swift‚Äôs eyes. Again, what would your code do?

Using strings for this kind of thing takes some very careful programming, but it‚Äôs also pretty inefficient ‚Äì do we really need to store all the letters of ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù to track one single day?

This is where enums come in: they let us define a new data type with a handful of specific values that it can have. Think of a Boolean, that can only have true or false ‚Äì you can‚Äôt set it to ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù or ‚Äúprobably‚Äù, because that isn‚Äôt in the range of values it understands. Enums are the same: we get to list up front the range of values it can have, and Swift will make sure you never make a mistake using them.

So, we could rewrite our weekdays into a new enum like this:

enum Weekday {
    case monday
    case tuesday
    case wednesday
    case thursday
    case friday
}
That calls the new enum Weekday, and provides five cases to handle the five weekdays.

Now rather than using strings, we would use the enum. Try this in your playground:

var day = Weekday.monday
day = Weekday.tuesday
day = Weekday.friday
With that change you can‚Äôt accidentally use ‚ÄúFriday ‚Äù with an extra space in there, or put a month name instead ‚Äì you must always choose one of the possible days listed in the enum. You‚Äôll even see Swift offer up all possible options when you‚Äôve typed Weekday., because it knows you‚Äôre going to select one of the cases.

Swift does two things that make enums a little easier to use. First, when you have many cases in an enum you can just write case once, then separate each case with a comma:

enum Weekday {
    case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
}
Second, remember that once you assign a value to a variable or constant, its data type becomes fixed ‚Äì you can‚Äôt set a variable to a string at first, then an integer later on. Well, for enums this means you can skip the enum name after the first assignment, like this:

var day = Weekday.monday
day = .tuesday
day = .friday
Swift knows that .tuesday must refer to Weekday.tuesday because day must always be some kind of Weekday.


let username: String
// lots of complex logic
username = "@twostraws"
// lots more complex logic
print(username)

/*

Enums let us create our own simple types in Swift so that we can specify a range of acceptable values such as a list of actions the user can perform, the types of files we are able to write, or the types of notification to send to the user.*/

Review
Wonderful job, we‚Äôve successfully created our own data type using structures and modeled dogs, books, and birds in our code!

In this lesson, we covered:

Structures are a means of modeling real-life objects programmatically.
How to create a structure using the struct keyword along with properties and methods.
Structure properties are used to describe the characteristics and values of the structure.
To model individual objects, we can create instances of structs, which may have unique property values.
We can access and edit properties using dot notation.
If we know that most of our instances will have a specific property value, we can assign default property values inside the struct.
Using the init() method allows us to provide an instance with specific values for the structure‚Äôs given properties.
Even without an init() method, structs come with a default memberwise initialization method that can 
assign values to declared properties inside a struct.
Structures can have methods that are functions accessible to their instances.
Structures are value types, any copied struct that has its properties altered will not 
affect the original structure from which it was copied.
